Test Repository of the current TIP APIs

TIP is an industry work group dedicated to promoting open interfaces to
streamline advertising transactions for local TV broadcasters and their media
agency partners. The consortium is formed of local television broadcasters
including Cox Media Group, E.W. Scripps, Fox Television Stations, Graham Media Group, Gray
Television, Hearst Television, NBCU and Telemundo Owned Stations, Nexstar Media
Group, Sinclair Broadcast Group, TEGNA Inc., and Univision.

The goal of TIP is to accelerate automation of spot television and to
streamline transactions and reduce the reconciliation burdens on buyer and
seller. TIP aims to foster interoperability between system providers to create
the broadest access to local television supply and demand. The TVB, the trade
association representing local broadcast television, provides a repository for
the TIP Initiativeâ€™s work and open access for industry partners at [TVB.org/TIP.](https://www.tvb.org/category/tip-transaction-standard/)

This Github repository houses the technical Open API Specification 3.0 (OAS3)
files that reflect the TIP 6.0.0. Framework in the Google document located
